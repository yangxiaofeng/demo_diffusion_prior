        <div class="content has-text-justified">
We present a unified framework aimed at improving the diffusion priors on 3D generation problems guided by diffusion models. Despite the significance of these tasks, current methods often struggle to produce high-quality results. In this paper, we consolidate the 3D generation problems as an optimization problem given a groundtruth score function, and propose an iterative optimization algorithm to facilitate effective learning. Based on the learnable parameters, our approach offers multiple configurations, affording various trade-offs between performance, implementation complexity, and efficiency. We show in experiments that our method largely improves the baseline methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results in the field of 3D generation. Remarkably, we find that while our primary focus lies in addressing 3D problems, our method demonstrates versatility in its applicability to 2D space, facilitating the generation and manipulation of 2D images. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights into recently proposed score distillation methods, such as the VSD loss and DDS loss.

## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
